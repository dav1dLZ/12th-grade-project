<h1> System that checks for infections </h1>

It's a system that checks for certain infections that works with the help of an Arduino Uno
with sensors 
The construction of this system is with the help of sensors:

<br>&bull; PH: A PH sensor is one of the most essential tools that is typically used for water measurements.<br/> 
This type of sensor is able to measure the amount of alkalinity and acidity in water and other solutions.
<br>
<br>&bull; Water Level Sensor Module: The sensor has ten exposed copper traces, five of which are power traces and the remaining five are sense traces. These traces are interlaced so that there is one sense trace between every two power traces.<br/>

<br> &bull; MQ-3 sensor: The MQ3 is a heater-driven sensor. It is therefore covered with two layers of fine stainless steel mesh known as an “anti-explosion network”. It ensures that the heater element inside the sensor does not cause an explosion because we are sensing flammable gas (alcohol). It also protects the sensor and filters out suspended particles, allowing only gaseous elements to pass through the chamber. When the outer mesh is removed, the sensor looks like this. The sensing element and six connecting legs that extend beyond the Bakelite base form the star-shaped structure. Two (H) of the six leads are in charge of heating the sensing element and are linked together by a Nickel-Chromium coil (a well-known conductive alloy). <br/>

<br> &bull; MQ-135: The gas sensor module consists of a steel exoskeleton under which a sensing element is housed. This sensing element is subjected to current through connecting leads. This current is known as heating current through it, the gases coming close to the sensing element get ionized and are absorbed by the sensing element. This changes the resistance of the sensing element which alters the value of the current going out of it. <br/>
